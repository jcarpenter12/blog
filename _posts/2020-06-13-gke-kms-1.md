### Overview
In this post I will go over setting up Google Cloud Build in order to deploy applications to the GKE cluster we created in the last post. Cloud build will also allow us to deploy secrets stored in Google’s Secret Manager without the need to upload them manually from another machine.

For this demonstration I will first create a simple Hello-World app and then modify the same app to use an API in order to demonstrate how secrets can be used in Kubernetes.

### Writing a Flask App and Running it Locally with Docker and Minikube
Flask is a widely used web app framework for Python, the first part of this post will cover creating a Hello World App, containerising it with Docker, running it using the Docker daemon and then running it on a local K8s cluster using Minikube. Once this has been completed I will go over deploying this same app to the GKE cluster created in the last post using Google Cloud Build.

In this example I have used pipenv to manage virtual python environments but you don’t have to use it, more info on pipenv can be found [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

The source code for the examples can be found [here](https://github.com/jcarpenter12/gke-kms-cloud-build)

{% highlight bash %}
# Initial setup for pipenv from within project directory
pipenv install flask

# Change into the pipenv virtual env
pipenv shell
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
# main.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=8080, host="0.0.0.0")
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
# Running the script locally
python main.py
{% endhighlight %}

### Running with Docker
First of all we need to create a Dockerfile with a list of instructions to import the python script and expose it on a port.

{% highlight docker %}
FROM python:3.6.9
RUN pip install pipenv
RUN mkdir app/
COPY Pipfile* /app/
RUN cd /app && pipenv lock --requirements > requirements.txt
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r /app/requirements.txt
COPY main.py /app/
WORKDIR app/
CMD ["python", "-u", "main.py"]
EXPOSE 8080
{% endhighlight %}


Then to build and run the docker container run the following

{% highlight bash %}

docker build . -t hello-world-flask

# -p below is used to map the port to your local machine
 docker run -p 8080:8080 hello-world-flask
{% endhighlight %}


Go to `localhost:8080` and you should see the same output as before, but this time the process is running on the docker container.

### Running with Minikube
Minikube is a tool that sets up a virtual kubernetes cluster on your machine. This step isn’t strictly necessary but I like to use Minikube during development in order to test that deployments and services work as expected without incurring the cost of running a kubernetes cluster. More info on Minikube can be found [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/)

In order to deploy the app to minikube we will first need to create a deployment and then expose it as a service in order to access it in a similar way as we have done with the docker run.

{% highlight bash %}
minikube start
# setup docker daemon with minikube
eval $(minikube docker-env)
# rebuild docker container on minikube daemon
docker build . -t hello-world-flask:latest
{% endhighlight %}

Once Minikube has started you should be able to interact with the cluster using kubectl.

Below is the file `k8s/deployment_mk.yaml`. This script consists of both the service and the deployment. The service is used to expose the app on a given port on the cluster.

{% highlight yaml %}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-world-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: hello-world
  ports:
  - protocol: "TCP"
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-world
        image: hello-world-flask:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Never
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
{% endhighlight %}


To apply the deployment run the following:

{% highlight bash %}
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment_mk.yaml
# Open service on minikube
minikube service hello-world-service
{% endhighlight %}

### Deploying to GKE with Google Cloud Build
The quick start guide for google cloud build can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstarts)

The process is divided into two stages. The first building the image and pushing it to Google Cloud Container Registry and the other deploying that image to the GKE cluster.

The first section of the yaml file dictates the steps for building the image and pushing it to the container registry

{% highlight yaml %}
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: [ 'build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/hello-world-flask', '.' ]
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/hello-world-flask']
{% endhighlight %}

Above the $PROJECT_ID is replaced at run time during the build with the project Cloud Build runs in.

The second part of the file describes the steps to push the deployment to the GKE cluster. Note the different file from the Minikube deployment, the reason for this being that Minikube needs to use a different image pull policy in order to run than a usual Kubernetes cluster.

The sed command here is used to replace the image name of the deployment file
at run time from the Cloud Build context (hacky I know)

{% highlight yaml %}
- name: 'bash'
  args: ['sed', '-i', 's/@@IMAGE_NAME@@/gcr.io\/$PROJECT_ID\/hello-world-flask/g', 'k8s/deployment.yaml']
- name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gke-deploy"
  args:
  - 'run'
  - '--filename'
  - 'k8s/deployment.yaml'
  - '--image'
  - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/hello-world-flask'
  - '--location'
  - 'europe-west2'
  - '--cluster'
  - 'default-cluster'
{% endhighlight %}

Note that the compute zone and container cluster must match your cluster.

Run the build
{% highlight bash %}gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
{% endhighlight %}

This will deploy the app to your GKE cluster. Navigate to the service in the console and access the link provided to see it running.

### Updating the App to use a Secret

Now that the hello world app is up and running, I am going to update it in to use an API in order to display the weather. This will demonstrate an example of how to secure and deploy secrets using Googles Secret Manager and Cloud Build.

For this example I am using the openWeather API which can be found [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/).

To follow along with this tutorial you will need to set up and account and generate an API key using the link above.

Once you have done that set the API key as an environment variable in your shell like so:

{% highlight bash %}
export OW_API_KEY=”yourapikey”
{% endhighlight %}

The basic python scripts now looks like this

{% highlight python %}

from flask import Flask
import os
import requests

# Constants
API_KEY = os.getenv("OW_API_KEY")
BASE_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/", defaults={"city": "london"})
@app.route("/<city>")
def weather(city):
    try:
        url = f"{BASE_URL}?q={city}&appid={API_KEY}"
        r = requests.get(url).json().get("weather")[0].get("description")
        return str(r)
    except Exception as e:
        raise e
        return "API Call Failed"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=8080, host="0.0.0.0")

{% endhighlight %}

All this script does is create a flask app that lets a user pass in the name of a city and returns the description of the current weather conditions for that city using the API.

As before run the script like so
{% highlight bash %}
python main.py
{% endhighlight %}

Pass in the name of the city required like so "http://0.0.0.0:8080/madrid". The
app will default to London if nothing is passed

#### Build the Docker Container

{% highlight docker %}
FROM python:3.6.9
RUN pip install pipenv
RUN mkdir app/
COPY Pipfile* /app/
RUN cd /app && pipenv lock --requirements > requirements.txt
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r /app/requirements.txt
COPY main.py /app/
WORKDIR app/
CMD ["python", "-u", "main.py"]
EXPOSE 8080
{% endhighlight %}

Build and run as follows
{% highlight bash %}
docker build . -t weather-app
# -e below maps your shell’s environment variable to the docker container
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e OW_API_KEY=$OW_API_KEY weather-app
{% endhighlight %}

#### Deploy to Minikube

The deployment file is largely the same as the one described above. The source for this deployment can be found [here](https://github.com/jcarpenter12/gke-kms-cloud-build/blob/devbranch/weather_app/k8s/deployment_mk.yaml)

{% highlight bash %}
minikube start
# setup docker daemon with minikube
eval $(minikube docker-env)
# rebuild docker on minikube daemon
docker build . -t weather-app
# In order to add the secret to minikube run the following, this creates a secret on the cluster
kubectl create secret generic weathersecret --from-literal=API_KEY=$OW_API_KEY
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment_mk.yaml
{% endhighlight %}

Once this has been run you will be able to access the service as before using

{% highlight bash %}
minikube service weather-app-service
{% endhighlight %}


#### Deploy to GKE

In order to deploy this app to GKE we need to add the API key secret to the Secret
Manager in the Google Cloud Console.

Go to the Secret Manager within the console and select 'Create Secret'

{% include image.html path="documentation/03_secret_manager.png" path-detail="documentation/03_secret_manager.png" alt="Chalk intro" %}

Once this has been completed we need to update the `cloudbuild.yaml` file in
order to deploy the secret to the cluster during the build

{% highlight yaml %}
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: [ 'build', '-t', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/weather-app', '.' ]
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'
  args: ['push', 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/weather-app']
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
  entrypoint: 'bash'
  args: [ '-c', 'gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=weathersecret > secret.txt' ]
- name: 'bash'
  args: ['sed', '-i', 's/@@IMAGE_NAME@@/gcr.io\/$PROJECT_ID\/weather-app/g', 'k8s/deployment.yaml']
- name: "gcr.io/cloud-builders/gke-deploy"
  args:
  - 'run'
  - '--filename'
  - 'k8s/deployment.yaml'
  - '--image'
  - 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/weather-app'
  - '--location'
  - 'europe-west2'
  - '--cluster'
  - 'default-cluster'
- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/kubectl'
  id: DeploySecret
  args: ['create','secret','generic','weathersecret','--from-file=API_KEY=secret.txt']
  env:
  - 'CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE=europe-west2'
  - 'CLOUDSDK_CONTAINER_CLUSTER=default-cluster'
{% endhighlight %}

Once this has beend deployed you should be able to access the service from
within the Cloud Console. GKE handles the envelope encryption of the secrets
for us on deployment to the cluster and that's all there is to it in terms of
deployment. All secrets are stored remotely in the Secret Manager and the GKE
handles the rest.

### Setting up a Cloud Build Trigger

Up until this point we have been running Google Cloud Build from our local
machine, but it can be set up in order to run whenever a change is made to a
repository or a pull request is merged.

Open the Cloud Build service from within the console and select 'Triggers',
'Connect Repository'

In this example I am using a repo in github but other git services can be used.

Authenticate to your chosen repository and choose the repo you want to set up a
trigger for.

Once you have created your trigger you can configure it to run from a specific
branch when a change is made and what files to run.

{% include image.html path="documentation/05_cb_trigger.png" path-detail="documentation/05_cb_trigger.png" alt="Chalk intro" %}

Then whenever you push to your repo, provided your conditions set in the
trigger have been met it will kick of a build and new entry will be made in the
Cloud Build History tab.
