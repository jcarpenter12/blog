## Securing secrets on Google Kubernetes Engine using Cloud Build and Google’s Key Management Service (KMS) - Part 1 Building the Infrastructure with Terraform
Over these next few posts I will go over the process for deploying and securing apps on GKE.

### Purpose
Kubernetes is a widely used framework used to run and manage containerised applications built using docker. Applications often require access to sensitive information, such as passwords or api keys that need to be stored on the cluster in ‘secrets’ (more info here https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). By default Google encrypts all customer content at rest but this still may not be secure enough for many applications, the reason being that the secrets are stored in the kubernetes etcd ( a key value store used to store data for the cluster) on the master node. If the etcd is accessed it means that the attacker would have access to the same secrets as being used by the applications that run on the cluster. This series of posts will go over how to enable application layer encryption on a gke cluster and build a CI/CD pipeline using cloud build in order to store and deploy secrets stored in google secrets manager to the cluster.
